# The Unofficial Gunn Web App "gunn-web-app"
The Gunn App was originally only available to [Android](https://github.com/RiceCakess/TheGunnApp) and [iOS](https://github.com/xaviloinaz/thegunnapp) users. Then recently it died. Then it came back to life.

We're going to make it in plain HTML, CSS, and JS so even people without a phone can view alternate schedules!

We aim to:

- make the app work offline
- mimic what the app does:
  - display the schedule based on the day, including alternate schedules
  - preview the schedule tomorrow
  - customise the names of your periods (eg "Period A" -> "Geo H") which saves
  - include a barcode generator for Flex which saves
  - list the staff names and their contact info that is searchable, and recent events
  - include an image of a map that can be zoomed in on and panned
- include extra functionality:
  - allow previewing of any day during the school year (credit to TS for the idea)
  - change the colour of your periods (eg #df453a for Period A) which saves
  - the map image can also be rotated
  - use Google Maps with a labeled overlay when connected to the internet
  - add other people's ideas faster because we can :D

We aim to try to support Chrome (and possibly Safari... thanks iOS ðŸ˜¡), so it'll work on any device that supports Chrome, minus iOS (unless we decide to support Safari)

You can help if you want. Giving us ideas is also helpful. And bug reports (though please include screenshots!)
