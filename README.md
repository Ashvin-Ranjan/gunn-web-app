# The Unofficial Gunn Web App "gunn-web-app"
The Gunn App was originally only available to [Android](https://github.com/RiceCakess/TheGunnApp) and [iOS](https://github.com/xaviloinaz/thegunnapp) users. Then recently it died.

We ,nobody, want to fix that. But instead of limiting it to Android and iOS (also because we, nobody, don't know how to make the proper apps in Android and iOS), we're going to make it in plain HTML, CSS, and JS!

The app will:

- work offline
- try to mimic what the app does

We, nobody, will try to support:

- Chrome
- Safari (unfortunately; blame iOS)

That means we, nobody, expect the app to work on:

- Chromebooks (unless the school blocks it... :/)
- iOS
- MacOS
- Android
- Linux
- Windows
- basically whatever supports Chrome, and iOS

If you want to help, then we won't be nobody anymore. But that's fine; I don't think people trust apps made by anonymous people, no?
