  Added a virtual bell, thanks to Matthew. It is off by default, but you can
  turn it on and test its volume in the Options.
</p>
<p>There are also some improvements to the club and staff lists:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Added a link button for linking to clubs and staff members</li>
  <li>
    Teacher schedules in the staff list now show room numbers (very useful)
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed non-teachers sharing a last name with a teacher stealing their
    schedules
  </li>
  <li>
    Misspellings in the chartered club list have been manually fixed, so links
    are now available for clubs like the Competitive Programming Club
  </li>
</ul>
