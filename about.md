# How to use
Really, the best way to learn is to experiment yourself. We plan to make some video tutorials in the future, however.

On **Macs, Windows, and Linux**, you can just bookmark this page or pin this tab (right click on the tab and select "pin" or whatever). On **Chromebooks**, you can also pin this page to the shelf (menu > more tools > add to shelf). On **iOS**, you can tap on the share icon and select "add to home screen" or whatever. On **Android**, tap on the menu and select "add to homescreen" or whatever.

# I have ideas! I found a problem!
There are two ways to submit suggestions and bug reports: if you have a GitHub account, you can [make a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Orbiit/gunn-web-app/issues/new); else, you can just spam me at [sy24484@pausd.us](mailto:sy24484@pausd.us).

We only intend to support Chrome and iOS Safari (the iOS Chrome app is just an embedded Safari with synced bookmarks), so if you aren't using one of those browsers ignore the last paragraph.

# About
The app was originally made to make the features of the Gunn App available to more users (that is, users who use platforms that support Chrome, plus iOS) and to increase competition on the original Gunn App to squeeze out more features from them.

This is open sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/Orbiit/gunn-web-app), if you want to waste your time reading incomprehensible spaghetti code.

# Credits
[Sean](https://sheeptester.github.io/) who made most of the app.

[Henry](https://poolehenry.github.io/) for his ideas, Google Maps overlay, and bug reports that came with screenshots.

Alex, [Steven](https://velosify.github.io/), Tomer, Aaryan, [Julien](https://gamepro5.github.io/) and some other people for moral support and ideas.

The [Android version of the Gunn App](https://github.com/RiceCakess/TheGunnApp) which was open sourced and I was able to get the Google Calendar events URL thing from their code. Apparently for me Java is to JavaScript as Interlingua is to Spanish.

[Google Search](https://www.google.com/), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) for their very helpful information. See, knowing how to program is just a fancy term for knowing how to Google.

The original Gunn App for what I better include in this app or Chromebook users'll feel left out.

[Material Design](https://material.io/) for their icons, colours, and specifications on how big buttons should be.
