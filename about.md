# I have ideas! I found a problem!
There are two ways to submit suggestions and bug reports: if you have a GitHub account, you can [make a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Orbiit/gunn-web-app/issues/new); else, you can just spam me at [sy24484@pausd.us](mailto:sy24484@pausd.us).

# About
The app was originally made to make the features of the Gunn App available to more users (that is, users who use platforms that support Chrome, plus iOS) and to increase competition on the original Gunn App to squeeze out more features from them.

This is open sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/Orbiit/gunn-web-app), if you want to waste your time reading incomprehensible spaghetti code.

# Credits
[Sean](https://sheeptester.github.io/) who made most of the app.

Henry for his ideas, Google Maps overlay, and bug reports that came with screenshots.

Alex and Steven for moral support.

The [Android version of the Gunn App](https://github.com/RiceCakess/TheGunnApp) which was open sourced and I was able to get the Google Calendar events URL thing from their code. Apparently for me Java is to JavaScript as Interlingua is to Spanish.

[Google Search](https://www.google.com/), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) for their very helpful information.

The original Gunn App for what I should better include in this app so Chromebook users won't feel left out.

[Material Design](https://material.io/) for their icons, colours, and specifications on how big buttons should be.
