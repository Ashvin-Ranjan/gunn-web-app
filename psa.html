<p>The week of February 26 is rather wacky. The school made last-minute changes to the week's schedule (due to a guest speaker, I believe), so UGWA originally did not reflect the changes. UGWA's alternate schedules are hard-coded in a hard-to-maintain file based on an out-of-date PDF on the school website, so it had to be manually changed to reflect the new schedule.</p>
<p>I won't update the schedule all the time, so UGWA won't always be accurate. Fortunately, <a href="https://orbiit.github.io/gunn-web-app/lite">Ugwita</a> (aka UGWA Lite) grabs alternate schedules from the school's Google Calendar, so it is more likely to be accurate (the Gunn App does this as well). Alternate schedules are also saved offline, and it is easier for me to maintain, so I will be more likely to fix any bugs on Ugwita.</p>
<p>If UGWA isn't working for you offline, you might be on the <strong>appdesign.html</strong> version, which was originally used during the development of UGWA. You should use the official <strong><a href="https://orbiit.github.io/gunn-web-app/">index.html</a></strong> version because if there are any major bugs, I will probably only fix the index.html version.</p>
