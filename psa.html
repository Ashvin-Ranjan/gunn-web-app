  <li>UGWA underwent an intensive weight loss program:<ul>
    <li>UGWA now doesn't request unnecessary information about the school's events</li>
    <li>more things such as the club and staff lists should be cached</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>force update button now restarts UGWA after a second; this might break things</li>
  <li>restart UGWA button at the bottom of options</li>
  <li>the PSA pop-up shows for new users now... whoops!</li>
  <li>UGWA starts up with a fade animation; not sure if this is a good change</li>
