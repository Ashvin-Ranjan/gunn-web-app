<p>Updates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>UGWA now properly deletes alternate schedules when the schools deletes them, so last Friday's schedule should be fixed now.</li>
  <li>After school on Friday, UGWA will now skip to Monday (the next school day) instead of Saturday</li>
  <li>Custom schedule overrides (used for PAUSD summer school) now show up properly in the week preview</li>
  <li>UGWA logs runtime errors now</li>
  <li>When displaying barcodes, the bars have been made taller and some of the big white areas have been made black, so it hopefully uses less battery when you turn up your brightness. The barcode orientation should also be easier to present to the scanner now unless your phone is super tiny</li>
</ul>
