<p>The school decided to surprise us with yet another completely unexpected alternate schedule that deviates from the nice pattern they made last semester. And again, it broke both versions of UGWA. (technically, only Ugwita had major problems; I just had to manually update UGWA)</p>
<p>Also, the weird schedule is yet again because of a guest speaker who will talk about <span style="font-size: 2em;">very <span style="font-size: 2em;">important </span><span style="font-size: 2em;">issues</span></span>. All hail the RISE Task Force.</p>
<p>Aaryan Agrawal is Supreme Leader of the Galaxy. Submit or die.</p>
