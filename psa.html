<p><a href="https://orbiit.github.io/gunn-web-app/lite/">UGWA Lite</a> is now out. It removes a bunch of useful features such as custom colours and period names, but at least the alternate schedules are saved offline! It is a temporary solution until Ugwa 2 comes out.</p>
<p>Also, stop using appdesign.html!</p>
