<p>It seems people don't like reading blocks of text; who knew? I'll keep this short.</p>
<p>UGWA now calculates alternate schedules as it fetches the other events from the school's Google Calendar and adds them to a cookie that stores those schedules, which UGWA and Ugwita share.</p>
<p>There's still no button that fetches all of the schedules at once, so you'll have to continue to use <a href="https://orbiit.github.io/gunn-web-app/lite/#refreshalts">Ugwita</a> for that.</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>Why not store all of the schedules in a JSON file that UGWA can fetch and cache?</strong> This is what UGWA did last year, but Gunn likes to change the alternate schedules throughout the year. Once, they announced a change the day before and forgot to update the Google Calendar. There was some confusion.</p>
<p><strong>Why not submit this app to Gunn and make it official?</strong> Imagine how horrifying it would be to see the U in "UGWA" stand for "official."</p>
<p><strong>Why not wrap this web app in some kind of fancy web embed thingy and submit it to the mobile app stores?</strong> Meh</p>
