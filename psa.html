<p>I've rectified the schedule for the last week; Tuesday has 4 extra minutes of lunch. UGWA isn't supposed to let you explore beyond the last day of school, so I'm not sure what will happen if you open UGWA after the last day of school, so <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M75VLQuFPrY">do not</a> open UGWA after June 1st.</strong></p>
<p>Annoyingly, last week on Tuesday there was a last-minute alternate schedule that resulted in a longer D period and a shorter flex; they didn't update their Google Calendar, so Ugwita didn't notice.</p>
<p>By the way, if you want the alternate schedules to work offline, you should check out <a href="https://orbiit.github.io/gunn-web-app/lite/">Ugwita</a>, an uglier version UGWA that works offline with only the core functionality (and a place to put whatever, like a to-do list).</p>
