<p>If you're still using appdesign.html, you should use the <a href="https://orbiit.github.io/gunn-web-app/">index.html</a> version, which should load faster (maybe) and works offline (somewhat). Feel free to keep this bookmarked or whatever since appdesign.html will continue to be used for future minor updates to UGWA 1. If the URL of this page does not say "appdesign.html" at the end, you probably have nothing to worry about.</p>
