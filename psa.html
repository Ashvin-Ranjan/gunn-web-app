<p>Fixed the issue where the Back to School night "period" was assumed to be in the morning. With this change, you will have to update your alternate schedules via <a href="https://orbiit.github.io/gunn-web-app/lite/#refreshalts">Ugwita</a>. I've changed the parsing algorithm so it can parse the school's weird inability to make new lines.</p>

<p>If you want to make your own Gunn app (please do, UGWA is lonely and needs friends), adding support for alternate schedules should be one of your highest priorities. I've compiled a list of different <a href="https://sheeptester.github.io/alt-schedule-parser-tester/tests/descriptions.txt">alternate schedule descriptions</a> the school uses in their Google Calendar that you can test your parser on. You can use my <a href="https://sheeptester.github.io/alt-schedule-parser-tester/">alternate schedule parser tester</a> to see a list of alternate schedules this year or test your own parser (if it's written in JavaScript).</p>
<p>UGWA has a habit of breaking, so you should be aware of the alternatives: <a href="https://orbiit.github.io/gunn-web-app/lite/">Ugwita</a> (it shows the time left in the tab title) and the <a href="https://orbiit.github.io/ugwa2/demo/schedules.html">Ugwa2 demo</a> (not finished but has the basic functionality, and not as ugly)</p>
<p>Take chem? You can use my <a href="https://sheeptester.github.io/hello-world/elements.html?safe=true">element flashcards</a> web app to memorise the required elements you need to know. I also have a web app that <a href="https://sheeptester.github.io/hello-world/sigfig.html">counts significant figures</a> (whether or not an integer is a counting number is left as an exercise to the reader).</p>
