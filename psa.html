<p>Updates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>UGWA now no longer assumes that the "Freshman Parents' Holiday Social" on November 28th is an actual no-school holiday, incorrectly marking that day as no school</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that on December 6th and 7th, there are a bunch of assemblies; UGWA incorrectly marks some of them as SELF, so check the events section for the actual schedule.</p>
<p>Enjoy your thanksgiving.</p>
