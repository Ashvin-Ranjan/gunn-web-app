<p>If UGWA says this Wednesday is a no-school day, that means that you're running an old cached version of UGWA and for some reason it refuses to update. If so, you can try going to <a href="https://orbiit.github.io/gunn-web-app/lite/#refreshalts">Ugwita</a> and clicking "Refresh alternate schedules" to fix it, then going back to UGWA.</p>
