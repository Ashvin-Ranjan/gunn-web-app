<p>Updates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>UGWA now shows the next day's schedule when the last period ends (as per <a href="https://github.com/Orbiit/gunn-web-app/issues/83">suggestion</a>)</li>
  <li>Default barcode is now 95000000 because people were reportedly accidentally signing in 95012345, who apparently exists (reported and fixed by <a href="https://github.com/Orbiit/gunn-web-app/pull/86">Timothy</a>)</li>
  <li>2018-10-10's schedule now shows flex/SELF instead of brunch (<a href="https://github.com/Orbiit/gunn-web-app/issues/85">bug report</a>)</li>
  <li>UGWA no longer briefly redirects new users to Ugwita</li>
  <li>The tab title now only shows the time until the end of the period when UGWA loses focus; this is an attempt to prevent Googlebot from seeing it, so it doesn't appear as <a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22133785/57056577-3befbd80-6c58-11e9-8102-4a816c6067ef.png">"Period F ended 2 hours and 5 minutes ago."</a> on Google</li>
</ul>
